## **Introduction**

Parents around the world know the frustration involved with naming their children.  You come across a good candidate for a name. Then you wonder, "Is it popular? How many other kids are going to have this name?" The Social Security Administration has a lot of information available.  I took this data and made it my own.  By using python and Streamlit, I collected the data and created a one of a kind web app to examine the historic naming trends in the United States from 1880 to 2022. All the user has to do is input a name and gender associated.
## **Process**
Using python, I combined 143 text files, containing an average of 30,000 entries. The lists were applied to Pandas dataframes and summary statistics and rankings were developed per name entered. I used the Streamlit platform to display a line graph of the frequency of names and dataframes beneath giving statistics and a full list of the numbers by year.

## Deployment on Streamlit

## Data Source
All names are from Social Security card applications for births that occurred in the United States after 1879. Note that many people born before 1937 never applied for a Social Security card, so their names are not included in our data. For others who did apply, our records may not show the place of birth, and again their names are not included in our data.

All data are from a 100% sample of our records on Social Security card applications as of March 2023.
