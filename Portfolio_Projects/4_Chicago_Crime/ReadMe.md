## **Introduction**
Many an aspiring Data/Crime Analyst have tackled the 'Chicago Crime' Dataset. The data is widely known and easy to obtain.  I chose to focus on a more recent dataset and limited it to the year 2018-2023. 

## **Methods**
I took a list of questions for the Chicago Crime set and included them with SQL queries.  I then took the dataset and created a Tableau Dashboard to display data with filters that apply to each metric.

The Tableau Dashboard is located [**here**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brian.harris5549/viz/ChicagoCrimeData_16963529348860/ChicagoCrime2018-2023)
## **Conclusion**
Crimes of theft have always been the highest category and battery/assault is the second.  There was a very sharp increase in crimes and cases during 2023. While Chicago is notorious for crime on the news and amongst analysts, it is only ranked 28th in the US for Murders per capita.  St. Louis is ranked number 1.

## **Acknowledgements**

I downloaded the dataset from kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashkanranjbar/chicago-crime .

I limited the years myself and the dataset is located [**here**](https://github.com/BrianHarrisCodes/Project/blob/main/Portfolio_Projects/4_Chicago_Crime/data/chicago_crime_2018_2023.csv)
