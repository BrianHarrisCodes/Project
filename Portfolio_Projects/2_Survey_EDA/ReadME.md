# Exploratory Data Analysis Using StackOverflow Survey Data

## **Introduction**
Every year the website StackOverflow.com sends out a survey to the web developers that use their site.  They then make the data public and release their own breakdown as well.

## **Process**
I used Python Jupyter Notebook to load the data in csv format.  I then went through and examined demographics and other items of interest within the dataset.  Using Pandas, I went through the dataframe created and made the data more user friendly.  After formatting the data, I went back and created some visuals using seaborn and matplotlib.

## **Data Source**

The data was located here: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/

## **Conclusion**

Most of the respondents for the Survey were in the United States. I was curious as to how popular the Python coding language was and it was in the top five. There was a fairly even distribution between hybrid and remote work location. Much less were reporting in-person employment, but that is more common with developers. Some errors did present themselves when examining the compensation data in the survey.  I'm not sure if any limits were set but I did see several entries where it stated that the developers were receiving millions in US converted Currency. That would seem to be a topic to follow-up with the administrators responsible for the survey.
