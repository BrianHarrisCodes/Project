# Webscraper Using Beautiful Soup

## Introduction
  In this project, I have utilized the webscraping abilities from the beautiful soup module and created a dataframe within JupyterNotebook.  I chose a Top 100 table of Contractors used by the United States Government.  This webpage is located on the website wikipedia.com and the link is below in the acknowledgements section.  Here is a screenshot of the original format on the site.

  Using python, I isolated the correct table from the page and changed it to a dataframe.  I then made a few adjustments to the columns and enhanced the readability. This is the format I kept:

   After it was converted to a pleasing format in the dataframe, I exported it to a csv file to be used at a later time or to share with others.
