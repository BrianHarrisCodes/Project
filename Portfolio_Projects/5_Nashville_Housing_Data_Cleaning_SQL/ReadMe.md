# Cleaning Nashville Housing Data Using SQL

## **Introduction**
I came across this data from Alex the Analyst online.  This data comes from a 2019 dataset.  Living in the Nashville area and having a background in Real Estate, I was interested in this project.

## **Process**
I used SQL to clean and normalize the data, looking for Null and inaccurate descriptions of the properties.  I parsed the address fields to more usable columns.  I then cleaned the tables by removing duplicates and deleting columns that were unnecessary.

## **Acknowledgements**
All data comes from Alex the Analyst on Youtube.
