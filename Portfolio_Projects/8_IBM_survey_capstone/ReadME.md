# Powerpoint Presentation of the Analysis of Trends within the Tech Industry

## **Introduction**
This project was a capstone for the IBM Data Analyst course I completed.  I used several tools and sources of data for the findings.

## **Process**
I utilized powerful IBM tools to visualize and interpret the data from StackOverflow Survey, Github Job postings, and a dataset of annaul salaries. I created Dashboards and included them within the slides.

## **Conclusion**
In comparison with the most recent survey data from Stack Overflow, the tech industry has made many shifts within a relatively short amount of time.  The survey from 2023 also has a strong trend toward Artificial Intelligence.
