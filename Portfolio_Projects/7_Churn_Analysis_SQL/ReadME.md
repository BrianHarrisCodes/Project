## **Introduction**
This was a final SQL project on the platform codecademy.com. The purpose was to take the data from a fictional company called 'Codeflix' and analyze the churn rate for its users.

## **Process**
Within this powerpoint slide presentation, I detail the process taken to identify key takeaways and calculate the churn rate of the target users and make a final recommendation on which course of action to take to improve membership.

## **Acknowledgements**
